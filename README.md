Hello, I am Sneha Mukherjee. In this repository, I have uploaded my first and second tasks given by LetsGrowMore. It is my pleasure to complete these tasks as I could gain knowledge on machine Learning and deep Learning through it. 
First task- Iris flower dataset classification using supervised machine learning
Second task- Normal image to pencil sketch transformation
